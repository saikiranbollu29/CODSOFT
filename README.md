## 📘 Project Overview

This project predicts **customer churn** for a subscription-based business.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue their service, helping companies take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Predict churn using customer demographics and service data.  
- Explore the impact of customer behavior on churn.  
- Evaluate multiple machine learning models.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

---

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
Includes features such as gender, tenure, monthly charges, internet service type, and churn label.

---

## 🧩 Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using **LabelEncoder**.  
- Handled missing values and scaled numerical columns.  
- Split data into training and testing sets (70/30).
