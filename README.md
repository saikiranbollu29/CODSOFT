## 🧠 TASK 1 — Credit Card Fraud Detection

### 📄 Description
Built a model to detect **fraudulent credit card transactions** using various supervised learning algorithms.  
The goal is to accurately classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

### 📊 Dataset
Dataset used from Kaggle:  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

### 🚀 Result
Achieved **99.3% accuracy** and **high recall score** using the **Random Forest Classifier**, ensuring efficient fraud detection.

## 🧠 TASK 2 — Customer Churn Prediction

### 📄 Description
Developed a predictive model to identify **customers likely to cancel their subscription** based on demographics, usage patterns, and service data.

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

### 📊 Dataset
Dataset used from Kaggle:  
[Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

### 🚀 Result
Achieved **85% accuracy** and **F1-score of 0.82** using the **Gradient Boosting Classifier**.  
Feature importance revealed **“tenure”** and **“monthly charges”** as key churn predictors.

## 🧠 TASK 3 — Spam SMS Detection

### 📄 Description
Created a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Legitimate)**.  
Utilized TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction.

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- Naive Bayes  
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 📊 Dataset
Dataset used from Kaggle:  
[SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

### 🚀 Result
Achieved **98.5% accuracy** using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** with TF-IDF features.  
Model efficiently distinguishes spam from genuine messages.
